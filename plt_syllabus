let's look at Programing Language Theory (PLT) 
according to wiki, an outline

alanzo's chruch and kleene's lambda calculus
noam chomsky's hierarchy
landin secd machine and it's relation to lambda calculus
landin j operator (for continuations)
landin iswim
strachey introduces terms parametric and ad hoc polymorphism
hoare's hoare logic (a form of axiomatic semantics)
howards's natural deduction -> curry-howard correspondence
scott's deontational semantics
logic programming (proog)
reynolds and girards (system F)
sussman and Steele's scheme language
milner's hindley miler type inference algoirthm
plotkin (structured operational semantics)
kahn (natural semantics)
kay's smalltalk
process calculi
lazy evaluation
moggi and wadler's monads


subfields
formal semantics
type theory
program analysis & transformation
generic & meta programming
domain specific languages
compiler construction

outline

lambda calculus

operational semantics (good lead into compiler construction?)

axiomatic semantics
  -hoare logic
    +loop invariant
    +forward vs backward assignment

denotational semantics
  -fixed points


first order logic and model theory
  -logic programming
  -horn clause
  -herbrand model

maybe these different types relate to different programming paradigms
hoare logic for imperative?
herbrand for logic?
dentotational for functional?
? for object oriented?
